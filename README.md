# cdr-processing-architectures
A Go benchmarking project comparing Pipeline (Daisy Chain) and Worker Pool concurrency patterns. It simulates a high-load Telecommunications CDR processing system to measure throughput and latency across CPU, Memory, and IO-bound stages, helping identify architectural bottlenecks in distributed data processing.
